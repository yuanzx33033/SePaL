## Self-Supervised Prototype Representation Learning for Event-Based Corporate Profiling (SePaL)

This package offers an implementation of SePaL. For more details, please see the paper (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346573809_Self-Supervised_Prototype_Representation_Learning_for_Event-Based_Corporate_Profiling)


## Framework Overview

we propose a Self-Supervised Prototype Representation Learning (SePaL) framework for dynamic corporate profiling. By exploiting the topological information of an event graph and exploring self-supervised learning techniques, SePaL can obtain unified corporate representations that are robust to event noises and can be easily fine-tuned to benefit various down-stream applications with only a few annotated data.
