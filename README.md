## Self-Supervised Prototype Representation Learning for Event-Based Corporate Profiling (SePaL)

This package offers an implementation of SePaL. For more details, please see the paper [Self-Supervised Prototype Representation Learning for Event-Based Corporate Profiling](https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AAAI-1174.YuanZ.pdf).


## Framework Overview

A Self-Supervised Prototype Representation Learning (SePaL) framework is proposed for dynamic corporate profiling. By exploiting the topological information of an event graph and exploring self-supervised learning techniques, SePaL can obtain unified corporate representations that are robust to event noises and can be easily fine-tuned to benefit various down-stream applications with only a few annotated data.
